ByteJunkies started out as a passion project around 2010 between two friends. We were talking about using the .NET framework to re-implement the CASINO virus back from the good ol' days of DOS malware. That was the point we decided to do joint research under the guise of "ByteJunkies."

Unfortunately, life being what life is, neither members of the team have been able to commit time and effort simultaneously. So our projects suffered, and were either incomplete or we were not able to work on things due to contractual obligations.

We will be attempting to do interesting research and coding projects, particularly focused on the .NET framework and the Microsoft ecosystem.

Currently a pentester of roughly 2 years, having changed careers after ~15 years in another unrelated industry. I hold Pentest+, AZ900 and CRTO certifications.

Interests are in malware and offensive capabilities development. Generally, I tend to fall down rabbit holes and leave projects unfinished while I research the next area I want to focus on. This trait definitely didn't help us in the earlier days of ByteJunkies.

I presented a [talk at BeerCon 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojTa_Tzn_UI) (which I will never watch, as it's painful) on the state of security in Technology Enabled Care (TEC), in which I highlighted a handful of the many issues around TEC vendor equipment. I'm planning to revisit this research at some stage and release the findings.

As you will notice, I'm not a professional programmer. I write very hacky code - I am the StackOverflow clich√© that the memes warned you about. That, and I read a lot of docs and try to make things "just work."
